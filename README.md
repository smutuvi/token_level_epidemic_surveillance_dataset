# Token-level Multilingual Epidemic Dataset for Event Extraction
This is a token-level annotated version of the freely available epidemiological dataset called [DAnIEL dataset](https://daniel.greyc.fr/public/index.php?a=corpus). The dataset consists of news articles in six different languages, namely French, Polish, English, Chinese, Greek, and Russian. In this dataset, an epidemiological event is represented by a disease name and the location of the reported event. For  example, each token of a disease name, based on the spans, is assigned the tags B-DIS, I-DIS, and O, marking the beginning (B-), intermediate (I-), and out-of-span markers (O).
