Anti O

While O
reading O
USA O
Today O
, O
I O
stumbled O
upon O
an O
article O
about O
a O
new O
trend O
of O
prospective O
hospital O
employees O
who O
have O
tested O
positive O
for O

rejected O
by O

. O

According O
to O
the O
article O
, O
these O
tobacco O
hiring O
policies O
are O
reinforced O
to O
encourage O
a O
healthy O
lifestyle O
and O
reduce O

The O
Centers O
for O

Control O

( O

estimates O
that O

193 O

, O
all O
the O
while O
taking O
more O
than O
400,000 O
lives O
annually O
. O

As O
a O
nursing O
student O
and O
a O
non O
smoker O
, O
I O
fully O
understand O
the O
deadly O
consequences O
of O
prolonged O
tobacco O
use O
and O
appreciate O
the O
logistics O
behind O
smoking O
bans O
. O

As O
a O
hospital O
employee O
, O
however O
, O
I O
find O
this O
anti O
smokers O
' O
ban O
to O
be O
discriminatory O
. O

Although O
I O
support O
a O
smoking O
ban O
within O
hospital O
perimeters O
and O
public O
areas O
, O
I O
cannot O
support O
employers O
discriminating O
against O
hard O
working O
Americans O
who O
choose O
to O
smoke O
outside O
of O
work O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
discriminating O
against O
smokers O
will O
open O
a O
gateway O
to O
other O
unconstitutional O
bans O
and O
create O
a O
slippery O
slope O
. O

If O
employers O
start O
banning O
smokers O
from O
the O
workplace O
, O
who O
will O
they O
discriminate O
against O
next O
? O

One O
reason O
employers O
discriminate O
against O
smokers O
is O
to O
decrease O
insurance O
premiums O
. O

However O
, O
according O
to O
CDC O
, O
the O
No O
. O

1 O
killer O
in O
America O
is O
heart O
disease O
. O

Increased O
rates O
of O
heart O
disease O
are O
closely O
related O
to O
the O
staggering O
obesity O
epidemic O
in O
America O
. O

Logically O
, O
it O
would O
make O
sense O
for O
employers O
to O
single O
out O
obese O
workers O
also O
. O

Like O
smoking O
, O
obesity O
can O
be O
controlled O
, O
yet O
if O
employers O
started O
to O
discriminate O
against O
obese O
workers O
, O
America O
would O
be O
outraged O
. O

How O
is O
this O
fair O
? O

Fortunately O
for O
smokers O
, O
the O
tobacco O
industry O
lobbied O
for O
smokers O
' O
rights O
and O
29 O
states O
now O
protect O
smokers O

The O
unfortunate O
news O
is O
that O
the O
federal O
government O
does O
not O
recognize O
smokers O
as O
a O
protected O
class O
and O
non O
profit O
organizations O
and O
health O
care O
companies O
can O
still O
openly O

smoke O

Over O
the O
past O
month O
, O
Novartis O
has O
worked O
hard O
to O
downplay O
the O
unexpected O
shutdown O
of O
a O
key O
manufacturing O
plant O
in O
Lincoln O
, O
Nebraska O
, O
where O
the O
drugmaker O
produces O
an O
assortment O
of O
widely O
used O
over O
the O
counter O
medicines O
and O
animal O
health O
drugs O
. O

In O
announcing O
the O
closure O
, O
Novartis O
noted O
that O
combined O
annual O
sales O
of O
the O
products O
made O
at O
the O
facility O
amount O
to O
less O
than O
2 O
percent O
of O
Novartis O
group O
sales O
overall O
( O
see O
here O
) O
. O

But O
the O
unfolding O
drama O
– O
which O
includes O
a O
scathing O
report O
issued O
last O
summer O
by O
FDA O
inspectors O
– O
may O
hurt O
more O
than O
the O
drugmaker O
would O
care O
to O
admit O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
one O
Wall O
Street O
analyst O
projects O
that O
lost O
sales O
could O
amount O
to O
$ O
560 O
million O
over O
the O
next O
12 O
months O
. O

Leerink O
Swann O

Seamus O
Fernandez O
calculates O
in O
an O
investor O
note O
that O
the O
missed O
opportunity O
to O
sell O
such O
stand O
bys O
as O
Excedrin O
, O
Bufferin O
and O
No O

represent O
about O
25 O
percent O
of O
US O
consumer O
sales O
, O
or O
about O
$ O
390 O
million O
, O
not O
including O
another O
$ O
170 O
million O
in O
incremental O
sales O
, O
assuming O
the O
shutdown O
lasts O
only O
three O
months O
. O

However O
, O
this O
does O
not O
include O
lost O
sales O
of O
animal O
health O
meds O
, O
such O
as O
the O
big O
selling O
Interceptor O
and O
Sentinel O
treatments O
for O
heartworm O
, O
or O
apparently O
contract O
manufacturing O
. O

Endo O
Pharmaceuticals O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
reported O
that O
prescription O
painkillers O
made O
at O
the O
facility O
wound O
up O
in O
some O
bottles O
for O
other O
meds O
, O
although O
it O
remains O
unclear O
if O
these O
were O
OTC O
or O
prescription O
( O
here O
is O
the O
FDA O
statement O
, O
in O
any O
event O
) O
. O

And O
of O
course O
, O
the O
shutdown O
might O
well O
last O
much O
longer O
. O

The O
drugmaker O
, O
he O
notes O
, O
expects O
to O
meet O
with O
the O
FDA O
later O
this O
month O
, O
giving O
Novartis O
execs O
an O
opportunity O
toprovide O
in O
time O
for O
the O
next O
earnings O
announcement O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
he O
notes O
that O
the O
suspension O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
affect O
up O
to O
$ O
1 O
. O
1 O
billion O
in O
global O
sales O
. O

” O
History O
suggests O
that O
few O
( O
manufacturing O
) O
challenges O
resolve O
quickly O
, O
but O
a O
partial O
resumption O
of O
( O
manufacturing O
) O
is O
certainly O
possible O
, O
although O
a O
resumption O
of O
manufacturing O
and O
a O
full O
recovery O
in O
the O
recalled O
brands O
are O
likely O
to O
take O
considerably O
longer O
to O
resolve O
, O
particularly O
given O
the O
FDA O
’s O
involvement O
, O
” O
he O
then O
adds O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
whether O
Novartis O
can O
avoid O
a O
lengthy O
shutdown O
is O
very O
unclear O
. O

The O
problems O
the O
FDA O
cited O
in O
the O
inspection O
report O
were O
so O
disturbing O
that O
the O
agency O
used O
capital O
letters O
and O
a O
bold O
font O
to O
emphasize O
that O
a O
pattern O
of O
problems O
existed O
. O

These O
problems O
included O
failures O
to O
respond O
to O
consumer O
complaints O
about O
bottles O
containing O
incorrect O
tablets O
, O
file O
reports O
with O
the O
FDA O
or O
send O
postage O
paid O
materials O
to O
consumers O
so O
that O
further O
evidence O
could O
be O
examined O
( O
here O
is O
the O
FDA O
report O
) O
. O

The O
drugmaker O
did O
not O
help O
it O
cause O
by O
insisting O
the O
problems O
were O
beyond O
its O
control O
, O
even O
though O
the O
FDA O
noted O
plant O
personnel O
failed O
to O
properly O
investigate O
many O
complaints O
and O
could O
not O
present O
any O
evidence O
to O
justify O
its O
conclusion O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
shutdown O
and O
subsequent O
recall O
came O
shortly O
after O
the O
FDA O
sent O
a O
warning O
letter O
to O
Novartis O
about O
manufacturing O
problems O
at O
three O
plants O
run O
by O
its O
Sandoz O
generic O
drug O
unit O
( O
look O
here O
) O
. O

It O
’s O
hard O
to O
avoid O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
FDA O
is O
searching O
for O
system O
issues O
and O
still O
other O
plants O
are O
going O
to O
be O
scrutinized O
. O

The O
worst O
case O
scenario O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
lengthy O
shutdown O
and O
possibly O
still O
more O
, O
depending O
upon O
how O
the O
FDA O
proceeds O
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
prospect O
of O
a O
consent O
decree O
. O

Remember O
that O
the O
FDA O
has O
pursued O
this O
step O
recently O
with O
Johnson O
& O
Johnson O
and O
Genzyme O
, O
and O
Wall O
Street O
is O
speculating O
that O
Hospira O
is O
up O
next O
( O
more O
here O
) O
. O

No O
one O
has O
suggested O
it O
may O
come O
to O
this O
, O
but O
the O
sort O
of O
problems O
that O
Novartis O
has O
caused O
and O
FDA O
interest O
in O
multiple O
plants O
make O
it O
likely O
the O
drugmaker O
will O
be O
preoccupied O
with O
manufacturing O
issues O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

And O
sales O
would O
have O
to O
take O
a O
hit O
. O

A O

the O
Royal O

( O

found O
its O

supported O
the O
role O
of O
the O
CQC O
but O
believe O
it O
needs O
to O
improve O
. O

It O
is O
recommending O
a O
series O
of O
measures O
, O
including O
that O
the O
CQC O
sets O
a O
two O

for O
responding O
to O
NHS O
staff O
who O
raise O
concerns O
about O
standards O
in O
their O
workplace O
. O

The O
regulator O
should O
also O
monitor O
and O
publish O
its O
success O
in O
meeting O
those O
targets O
and O
, O
if O
it O
cannot O
meet O
them O
, O
must O
look O
again O
at O
whether O
more O
staff O
are O
needed O
. O

The O
CQC O
has O
come O
in O
for O
heavy O
criticism O
in O
recent O
months O
, O
including O
over O
missed O
deadlines O
for O
registering O

in O
three O
nurses O
surveyed O
by O
the O
RCN O
( O
35 O

) O
said O
they O
did O
not O
believe O
the O
CQC O
sufficiently O
takes O
into O
account O
the O
importance O
of O
staffing O
levels O
on O
NHS O
wards O
, O
or O
the O
skills O

of O
staff O
. O

The O
RCN O
has O
repeatedly O
raised O
concerns O
about O
low O
staffing O
levels O
contributing O
to O
poor O
patient O

, O
and O
how O

changed O
the O
skills O
mix O
between O
numbers O
of O
fully O
qualified O
and O
unqualified O
staff O
. O

Many O
nurses O
in O
the O
survey O
also O
had O
concerns O
about O
the O
consistency O
of O
inspections O
across O
England O
, O
the O
RCN O
said O
. O

RCN O
chief O
executive O
Dr O
Peter O
Carter O
said O
: O
“ O
Having O
the O
right O
numbers O
and O
mix O
of O
healthcare O
professionals O
is O
pivotal O
to O
delivering O
high O
standards O
of O
patient O
care O
and O
outcomes O
. O

“ O
It O
is O
therefore O
very O
worrying O
that O
nurses O
feel O
that O
the O
CQC O
does O
not O
focus O
enough O
on O
staffing O
levels O
in O
hospitals O
and O
care O
homes O
, O
and O
has O
a O
lack O
of O
experienced O
staff O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
inspections O
. O

This O
clearly O
undermines O
the O
credibility O
of O
its O
work O
. O
” O
The O
RCN O
wants O
the O
CQC O
to O
report O
specifically O
on O
staffing O
levels O
during O
its O
inspections O
, O
including O
the O
ratio O
of O
registered O
nurses O
to O
other O
staff O
. O

It O
should O
also O
develop O
an O
appropriate O
tool O
to O
determine O
staffing O
levels O
and O
nurse O
to O
patient O
ratios O
, O
it O
said O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
CQC O
should O
also O
ensure O
all O
providers O
have O
an O
unannounced O
inspection O
once O
a O
year O
and O
inspectors O
should O
speak O
to O
staff O
– O
both O
junior O
and O
senior O
– O
without O
managers O
present O
so O
staff O
can O
speak O
freely O

Dr O

“ O
There O
is O
no O

that O

that O

hold O
the O

in O
the O

six O

Starting O
in O

, O
however O
, O
federal O
health O
transfer O
increases O
will O
be O
linked O
to O
the O
rate O
of O
the O
country O
' O

economic O
growth O
including O
inflation O
which O
is O
about O

there O
will O
be O
a O
floor O
of O
three O

There O
is O
much O
that O
can O
be O
criticized O
about O
this O
solution O
to O
the O
health O
transfer O
issue O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
herald O
a O
departure O
of O
the O
federal O
government O
from O
any O
attempt O
at O
national O
health O
standards O
or O
fostering O
innovation O
as O
the O
money O
is O
to O
be O
transferred O
no O
strings O
attached O
. O

Thus O
, O
there O
is O
no O
federal O
commitment O
to O
try O
to O
improve O
health O
care O
delivery O
. O

Federal O
Health O
Minister O
Leona O
Aglukkaq O
has O
stated O
future O
federal O
provincial O
discussions O
will O
now O
be O
more O
about O
performance O
measurement O
, O
accountability O
and O
sharing O
of O
best O
practices O
rather O
than O
money O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
health O
, O
critics O
might O
argue O
Canada O
now O
has O
the O
federation O
from O
Star O
Trek O
with O
the O
role O
of O
the O
federal O
government O
being O
simply O
to O
observe O
and O
report O
rather O
than O
involve O
itself O
in O
provincial O
affairs O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
one O
has O
to O
conclude O
that O
given O
that O
health O
is O
a O
provincial O
sphere O
of O
jurisdiction O
, O
the O
federal O
transfer O
solution O
is O
both O
clever O
and O
sound O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
cleverness O
, O
announcing O
the O
new O
arrangement O
the O
week O
before O
Christmas O
when O
the O
public O
' O
s O
attention O
was O
elsewhere O
was O
inspired O
. O

And O
if O
they O
were O
paying O
any O
attention O
they O
would O
merely O
note O
Ottawa O
was O
giving O
money O
the O
Christmas O
gift O
that O
is O
always O
appreciated O
making O
complainers O
seem O
ungrateful O
. O

Moreover O
, O
Ottawa O
is O
maintaining O
six O
per O
cent O
increases O
until O
2017 O
the O
world O
should O
last O
so O
long O
. O

The O
fact O
is O
the O
provinces O
have O
stable O
federal O
funding O
to O
plan O
for O
the O
day O
when O
growth O
in O
federal O
transfers O
slows O
. O

Federal O
health O
transfers O
are O
a O
key O
component O
of O
provincial O
health O
spending O
, O
accounting O
for O
about O
20 O
per O
cent O
of O
their O
expenditures O
and O
are O
therefore O
an O
important O
driver O
of O
spending O
. O

The O
federal O
government O
is O
creating O
the O
incentive O
for O
provinces O
to O
bend O
the O
health O
care O
cost O
curve O
but O
gradually O
and O
without O
a O
one O
size O
fits O
all O
policy O
. O

One O
of O
the O
advantages O
of O
a O
federal O
form O
of O
government O
is O
that O
it O
can O
foster O
diversity O
and O
innovation O
in O
the O
production O
and O
delivery O
of O
public O
services O
. O

The O
provinces O
now O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
do O
just O
that O
to O
health O
care O
. O

The O
money O
, O
however O
, O
is O
being O

no O

, O
no O
push O
for O

Those O
who O
might O
want O
to O
see O
future O
federal O
action O
on O
a O
national O
drug O
plan O
will O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Those O
who O
see O
the O
role O
of O
the O
federal O
government O
as O
an O
enforcer O
of O
regional O
equity O
in O
health O
care O
services O
will O
also O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Those O
provinces O
currently O
unhappy O
with O
the O
new O
transfer O
deal O
, O
however O
, O
would O
also O
cry O
lamentations O
of O
domineering O
federalism O
and O
unwarranted O
federal O
intrusion O
if O
the O
federal O
government O
became O
more O
interventionist O
in O
applying O
national O
heath O
standards O
. O

The O
federal O
government O
has O
extricated O
itself O
from O
these O
types O
of O
political O
health O

operas O
and O
in O
future O
all O
the O
provinces O
will O
be O
more O
careful O
about O
what O
they O
wish O
for O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
amounts O
are O
reasonable O
. O

Six O
per O
cent O
until O

five O
more O

growth O

Of O
course O
, O

He O
said O
the O
current O
findings O

in O

with O
other O
research O
suggesting O
that O
although O
vitamin O

deficiency O
might O
be O
more O
common O
in O
people O
with O
COPD O
, O
higher O
levels O
don’t O
necessarily O
seem O
to O
equate O
with O
fewer O
symptoms O
. O

“ O
Unfortunately O
the O
results O
have O
been O
somewhat O
disappointing O
, O
” O
Kunisaki O
said O
. O

“ O
Right O
now O
there O
’s O
no O

also O
proposed O

He O
said O
that O

team O
’s O
lack O
of O
positive O
findings O
, O
people O
with O

“ O
If O
you’re O
deficient O

you O

If O
no O

then O
it O
is O
important O
for O
you O
to O
know O
that O
today O

the O
third O
Monday O

is O
depressing O
for O
most O
of O
the O
people O

is O
a O
psychological O
reason O
behind O
people O
feeling O
sad O
on O
third O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
by O
third O

, O
most O
of O
the O
people O
give O
up O
their O

even O
forget O

Mr O

from O
the O
Cardiff O

discovered O
blue O
Monday O
six O
years O

. O

However O
, O
it O
has O
been O
estimated O
that O
this O
year O
there O
would O
be O
more O
depressed O
people O
then O
there O
were O
last O
year O
. O

In O
January O
many O
people O
faces O
financial O
difficulties O
as O
they O
tend O
to O
spend O
allot O
more O

Those O
who O
are O
critical O

are O
of O
the O
view O
that O
the O
concept O

been O
created O
by O
the O
travel O

tourism O
company O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
travelling O

try O
to O
attract O
customers O
by O
promising O
them O
of O
relaxing O

which O
would O
ultimately O
add O

There O
are O
some O

who O
call O
Mr O

Arnall O

theory O
stupid O

The O
introduction O
of O
these O
two O
machines O
sets O
the O
stage O
for O
a O
dramatic O
duel O
between O
perhaps O
the O
two O
most O
important O
executives O
in O
the O
commercial O
turf O
war O
that O
has O
led O
the O
speed O
of O
reading O
genomes O
to O
fall O
even O
faster O
than O
the O
tech O
industry O
’s O
famous O
Moore O
’s O
Law O
that O
juiced O
the O
speed O
of O
microprocessors O
. O

On O
one O
side O
is O
Flatley O
, O
who O
by O
launching O
a O
machine O
called O
the O
Genome O
Analyzer O
five O
years O
ago O
set O
DNA O
sequencing O
on O
a O
rapid O
track O
that O
has O
dropped O
the O
price O
of O
sequencing O
a O
person O
’s O
DNA O
from O
$ O
500,000 O
to O
less O
than O
$ O
5,000 O
. O

On O
the O
other O
is O
Jonathan O
Rothberg O
, O
who O
heads O
Life O
’s O
Ion O
Torrent O
division O
. O

Rothberg O
introduced O
the O
first O
of O
a O
new O
generation O
of O
faster O
DNA O
sequencers O
, O
only O
to O
have O
his O
company O
bought O
by O
Roche O
and O
then O
dominated O
by O
Flatley O
and O
Illumina O
. O

A O
year O
ago O
, O
Rothberg O
and O
Life O
launched O
a O
new O
DNA O
sequencer O
, O
the O
Personal O
Genome O
Machine O
, O
that O
could O
do O
small O
sequencing O
jobs O
( O
think O
looking O
at O
the O
tiny O
genomes O
of O
bacteria O
) O
and O
had O
a O
price O
tag O
of O
only O
$ O
50,000 O
, O
and O
cost O
an O
additional O
$ O
100 O
each O
time O
it O
was O
run O
. O

Illumina O
introduced O
its O
own O
small O
machine O
, O
the O
MiSeq O
, O
that O
allowed O
researchers O
to O
get O
same O
day O
results O
at O
a O
cost O
of O
$ O
100,000 O
per O
machine O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
Ion O
Torrent O
PGM O
has O
proved O
more O
popular O
. O

The O
time O
it O
takes O
to O
get O
results O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
few O
complaints O
genetics O
researchers O
have O
had O
about O
Illumina O
’s O
technology O
. O

It O
can O
take O
eight O
days O
to O
generate O
genetic O
data O
, O
and O
then O
there O
is O
another O
bottleneck O
as O
computers O
must O
analyze O
it O
. O

Making O
same O
day O
analysis O
possible O
is O
seen O
as O
vital O
as O
researchers O
try O
to O
move O
DNA O
into O
the O
clinic O
. O

With O
the O
new O
machine O
he O
is O
introducing O
, O
Flatley O
is O
reducing O
the O
selling O
point O
of O
the O
new O
Ion O
Torrent O
machine O
. O

But O
Flatley O
’s O
not O
eliminating O
some O
major O
selling O
points O
for O
the O
new O
machine O
, O
says O
Chad O
Nusbaum O
, O
the O
co O
director O
of O
the O
Genome O
Sequencing O
and O
Analysis O
Program O
at O
the O
Broad O
Institute O
and O
an O
early O
customer O
on O
the O
new O
Ion O
Torrent O
system O
. O

He O
says O
he O
expects O
data O
quality O
on O
the O
new O
Ion O
Torrent O
system O
to O
be O
worse O
, O
but O
not O
so O
much O
so O
that O
collecting O
extra O
runs O
won’t O
help O
. O

And O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
, O
the O
low O
cost O
to O
buy O
the O
Ion O
Torrent O
machine O
is O
likely O
to O
win O
it O
fans O
. O

“ O
The O
speed O
is O
good O
, O
but O
the O
cost O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
blocker O
, O
” O
for O
the O
new O
Illumina O
machine O
says O
Nusbaum O
. O

“ O
We’re O
in O
a O
world O
where O
you O
can O
buy O
a O
machine O
for O
a O
lot O
less O
. O

Now O
machines O
are O
getting O
cheap O
again O
, O
and O
I O
think O
that O
is O
what O
the O
world O
is O
going O
to O
expect O
. O

Otherwise O
it O
costs O
you O
too O
much O
to O
get O
in O
the O
game O
. O
” O
In O
other O
words O
, O
Flatley O
finally O
has O
some O
competition O
– O
and O
it O
’s O
not O
so O
much O
like O
Apple O
, O
the O
company O
both O
men O
idolize O
, O
but O
more O
like O
Dell O
: O
cheaper O
, O
easier O
to O
get O
, O
and O
at O
least O
as O
good O
. O

The O
real O
winners O
, O
as O
they O
continue O
to O
compete O
for O
both O
scientific O
business O
and O
a O
potential O
role O
in O
the O
future O
of O
medicine O
, O
are O
likely O
to O
be O

It O

“ O
It O

building O

The O
study O

If O
they O
would O
be O
able O
to O

they O
hope O

inserting O

on O

withdrawn O

five O
centimetres O
from O

the O

initially O

seemed O
a O

margin O

Dr O
McLean O
said O
that O
the O
deeper O
the O
catheter O
went O
into O
the O

the O
greater O
the O

, O

a O
result O
of O

a O

( O

from O
another O
child O
while O
on O

The O

developed O

sought O

, O
although O
apparently O
no O

When O

the O

a O

she O
was O
declared O

This O
sad O

will O
surely O
bring O
up O
the O

whether O

There O
are O

the O

, O
whether O

that O

by O

The O

this O

that O
the O

Sharon O

surgery O
in O

after O
their O
appearance O
was O
affected O
by O
the O
birth O
of O
her O
third O

the O
procedure O
at O
the O
former O
Dryburn O
Hospital O
in O
Durham O

returned O
to O
her O
normal O
day O
to O
day O
after O
a O
seemingly O
successful O
operation O
. O

In O
the O
past O
couple O
of O
years O
she O
began O
experiencing O
pain O
and O
a O
subsequent O
scan O
has O
revealed O
that O
the O
left O
implant O
has O
ruptured O

PIP O
implants O
are O
currently O
at O
the O

a O
health O

it O

she O
has O
to O
go O
through O
the O

more O
surgery O
, O
Sharon O
is O
thankful O
that O
her O
implant O
procedure O
was O
done O
on O
the O

which O
will O
now O
pay O
for O
the O

replacement O

Many O
women O
who O
paid O
for O

had O
been O

pain O
, O
she O
didn’t O
begin O
to O
panic O
until O
she O
received O
a O
letter O
in O
2010 O
stating O
that O
she O

Gemma O
, O
a O
former O
Miss O
Great O
Britain O
had O
surgery O
in O
2008 O
, O
not O
because O
she O
wanted O
to O
be O
a O
larger O
cup O
size O
but O
because O
she O
was O
self O
conscious O
that O
one O
of O
her O
breasts O
was O
bigger O
than O
the O
other O
. O

Working O
as O
a O
model O
at O
the O
time O
made O
her O
even O
more O
aware O
of O
the O
difference O
and O
she O
decided O
to O
seek O
the O
advice O
of O
a O
breast O
surgeon O
to O
see O
if O
she O
could O
have O
corrective O
surgery O
. O

“ O
I O
didn’t O
want O

was O
a O
size O
8 O

at O

were O

full O

even O
a O
D O
cup O
which O
I O
was O
happy O
with O
, O
” O
she O
says O
. O

Gemma O
went O
online O
to O
research O
breast O
surgeons O
and O
in O
the O
end O
opted O
for O
a O
London O
consultant O
who O
had O
been O
recommended O
by O
model O
friends O
in O
the O
city O

He O
recommended O
breast O
implants O
to O
correct O
the O
size O
variance O
in O
her O
breasts O
although O
Gemma O
later O
discovered O
there O
were O
corrective O
surgery O
options O
open O
to O
her O
which O
he O
didn’t O
mention O
. O

At O
£ O
5,000 O
, O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
surgery O
was O
more O
than O
double O
what O
many O
other O
places O
were O
charging O
but O
this O
only O
served O
to O
reassure O
Gemma O
that O
she O
was O
paying O
for O
the O
best O
. O

She O
says O
: O
“ O

was O

be O
silicone O

one O
of O
her O
breasts O

become O
lumpy O

that O

for O

, O
the O

offer O
several O
possible O
explanations O

Fletcher O
says O
some O
employers O
may O
be O
reluctant O
to O
hire O
workers O
with O
diabetes O
or O
may O
pay O
them O
less O
to O
account O
for O
higher O
health O
care O
costs O
— O
a O
practice O
that O
is O
illegal O
if O
it O
can O
be O
proven O
. O

If O
diabetic O
workers O
are O
absent O
more O
frequently O
, O
they O
also O
may O
be O
passed O
over O

promotions O
. O

They O
may O
also O
avoid O
leaving O
a O
company O

seek O
better O
opportunities O

fear O
losing O

‘ O

‘ O
Our O

essentially O
similar O

often O
find O
that O

. O

‘ O
Rather O
than O
being O
put O
off O

, O
parents O
should O
have O
more O
realistic O
expectations O

cope O
with O
difficult O
infant O

if O

. O

‘ O
These O
approaches O
could O
potentially O
promote O
successful O

, O
because O
currently O
many O

that O
go O
with O

is O
exercise O

The O
catch O
is O
that O
some O
are O
simply O
too O
ill O

Researcher O
are O
now O
claiming O
that O
they O
have O
created O
a O

give O
the O

it O
the O

benefits O

without O
having O

The O
hormone O
in O
the O
pill O
is O
being O
called O
irisin O
and O
occurs O
naturally O
in O
the O
body O

According O
to O
the O
researchers O
, O
this O
hormone O
is O
found O
in O
normal O
muscle O
cells O

triggers O
the O
calorie O

It O
was O
then O
time O
to O
get O
the O
bed O
bugs O
out O
. O

The O
bugs O
in O
question O
had O
been O
fed O
a O
week O
previously O
, O
and O
then O
starved O
, O
so O
they O
were O
eager O
to O
eat O
. O

Volunteers O
were O
asked O
to O
look O
away O
while O
a O
researcher O
put O
a O
bug O
on O
one O
of O
the O
skin O
patches O
. O

The O
volunteer O
was O
then O
supposed O
to O
record O
, O
using O
a O
press O
button O
counter O
, O
the O
number O
of O
times O
he O
perceived O
the O
insect O
moving O
on O
his O
skin O
. O

The O
difference O
was O
significant O
. O

When O
the O
bug O
was O
on O
a O
hairy O
patch O
it O
was O
detected O
, O
on O
average O
, O
every O
four O
seconds O
. O

When O
it O
was O
on O
a O
shaved O
patch O
, O
more O
than O
ten O
seconds O
elapsed O
between O
detections O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
bugs O
seemed O
to O
find O
it O
harder O
to O
locate O
a O
good O
spot O
to O
bite O
when O
they O
were O
surrounded O
by O
hair O
. O

Though O
no O
volunteer O
was O
actually O
bitten O
, O
because O
the O
vigilance O
of O
the O
watching O
researcher O
meant O
the O
insects O
were O
removed O
when O
they O
extended O
their O
probosces O
prior O
to O
biting O
, O
bugs O
on O
hairy O
skin O
took O
about O
a O
fifth O
longer O
than O
those O
on O
shaved O
skin O
to O
attempt O
to O
bite O
their O
hosts O
. O

In O
both O
cases O
men O
( O
who O
are O
hairier O
than O
women O
, O
as O
measured O
by O
the O
density O
of O
follicles O
and O
the O
length O
of O
the O
vellus O
hair O
) O
were O
better O
off O
than O
women O
when O
the O
bugs O
were O
released O
on O
unshaven O
patches O
of O
skin O
, O
though O
there O
was O
no O
significant O
difference O
between O
the O
sexes O
when O
they O
were O
shaved O
. O

The O
upshot O
is O
that O
, O
whatever O
the O
reason O
why O
human O
body O
hair O
has O
shrunk O
, O
one O
reason O
it O
has O
not O
disappeared O
completely O
is O
because O
it O
warns O
and O
protects O
those O
who O
sport O
it O
from O
the O
attentions O
of O
hostile O
insects O

In O
recent O
weeks O
I’ve O
had O
occasion O
to O
wonder O
whether O
Talmudic O
scholars O
of O
yore O
ever O
debated O
the O
question O
of O
what O
to O
do O
when O
a O
nice O
Jewish O
boy O
came O
down O
with O
swine O
flu O
. O

Less O
shameful O
than O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
trichinosis O
, O
perhaps O
, O
in O
which O
the O
subject O
would O
surely O
be O
harshly O
judged O
for O
his O
complicity O

partaken O

undercooked O
pork O

Yet O
hasn’t O

this O
was O
not O

on O
my O
mind O
when O
, O
in O
2006 O

my O

warned O
of O
the O
imminent O
onset O
of O
an O
avian O
flu O
“ O
pandemic O
” O
of O
lethal O

comparable O
to O
the O

Maybe O
we O
should O
have O
discarded O
them O
earlier O
, O
but O
our O
decision O
to O
keep O
them O
was O
no O
doubt O
influenced O
by O
a O
media O
campaign O
in O
2009 O
that O
proclaimed O
the O

yet O
another O

time O
it O
was O

protect O

reduce O

improve O
the O
quality O

develop O
more O

, O
promoting O

making O
more O

improve O

by O
ensuring O
effective O

efficient O
allocation O
and O
utilisation O
of O
available O
resources O
; O
and O
ensure O
that O
we O
look O
after O
the O
most O
vulnerable O
in O
our O
society O
and O
the O
children O
, O
the O
future O
for O
this O
country O
. O

To O
meet O
this O
challenge O
we O
must O
stop O
doing O
what O
does O
not O
work O
, O
challenge O
out O
of O
date O
practices O
and O
acknowledge O
that O
some O
services O
are O
no O

To O

, O
with O

This O
is O
why O
I O
commissioned O
this O
review O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
blueprint O
for O
reform O
. O

I O
laid O
down O
a O
challenge O
to O
the O

team O
: O
to O
examine O
the O
future O

the O

the O

meet O
our O
priorities O
. O

This O
review O
is O
not O
about O
cost O

. O

It O
is O
about O
quality O
, O
accessibility O
and O
safety O
of O
patient O
care O
. O

As O
the O
financial O
situation O
tightens O
, O
there O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
radical O
shift O
in O
where O
and O
how O
that O
money O
is O
used O
. O

I O
am O
not O
naive O
. O

I O
have O
always O
known O
that O
the O
review O
would O
make O
recommendations O
that O
will O
be O
challenging O
and O
I O
will O
not O
shirk O
hard O
decisions O
. O

However O
, O
commissioning O
this O
review O
was O
not O
a O
difficult O
decision O
. O

Indeed O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
irresponsible O
of O
me O
not O
to O
do O
so O
in O
light O
of O
the O
issues O
facing O
us O
. O

The O
proposals O
in O
this O
report O
represent O
radical O
change O
, O
which O
will O
provide O
a O
more O
citizen O
focused O
and O
effective O
health O
service O
. O

The O
evidence O
collected O
through O
engagement O
with O
more O
than O
3,000 O
people O
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

Our O
people O
feel O
that O
improvements O
are O
necessary O
. O

The O
review O
proposes O
a O
model O
which O
places O
the O
individual O
at O
its O
centre O
. O

Health O
and O
social O
care O
services O
will O
be O
increasingly O
accessible O
in O
local O
areas O
. O

Patients O
will O
deal O
with O
fewer O
professionals O
and O
will O
be O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
decision O
making O
about O
their O
treatment O
. O

There O
will O
be O
a O
significant O
shift O
from O
provision O
of O
services O
in O
hospitals O
to O
provision O
of O
services O
in O
the O
GP O
surgery O
, O
closer O
to O
home O
, O
where O
it O
is O
safe O
and O
effective O
to O
do O
this O
. O

Services O
will O
regard O
home O
as O
the O
hub O
and O
ensure O
that O
people O
can O
be O
cared O
for O
at O
home O
, O
including O
at O
the O
end O
of O
life O
. O

Where O
specialist O
hospital O
care O
is O
required O
it O
will O
be O
available O
with O
patients O
being O
discharged O
into O
the O
care O
of O
local O
services O
as O
soon O
as O
their O
health O
and O
care O
needs O
permit O
. O

The O
review O
proposes O
hospitals O
will O
work O
as O
a O
system O
, O
with O
each O
facility O
contributing O
to O
the O
provision O
of O
a O
total O
service O
to O
its O
population O
. O

This O
will O
mean O
change O
in O
all O
sites O
over O
a O
five O
year O
period O
. O

A O
key O
aspect O
of O
this O
approach O
is O
that O
critical O
clinical O
staff O
will O
be O
employed O
to O
work O
in O
a O
hospital O
system O
and O
will O
be O
a O
resource O
for O
each O
population O
working O
as O
necessary O
across O
hospital O
services O
and O
facilities O
. O

The O
review O
envisages O
change O
at O
several O
of O
the O
current O
acute O
hospital O
sites O
it O
suggests O
a O
likely O
position O
, O
over O
time O
, O
of O
five O
to O
seven O
major O
acute O
hospital O
networks O
in O
Northern O
Ireland O
. O

However O
, O
the O
key O
test O
for O
any O
future O
service O
configuration O
has O
to O
be O
sustainability O
and O
resilience O
in O
clinical O
terms O
. O

It O
will O
be O
on O
that O
basis O
that O
we O
are O
able O
to O
determine O
whether O
an O
acute O
hospital O
is O
viable O
. O

I O
recognise O
fully O
the O
need O
for O
greater O
productivity O
from O
the O
resources O
available O
to O
us O
, O
particularly O
in O
these O
times O
of O
austerity O
, O
and O
it O
is O
in O
that O
context O
that O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
the O
greater O
involvement O
of O
frontline O
professionals O
in O
decision O
making O
and O
service O
development O
is O
essential O
. O

Local O
commissioning O

too O
, O
has O
a O
crucial O
and O
powerful O
role O
to O
play O
in O
driving O

involving O
over O
6,000 O

They O
found O
that O

relevant O
doses O

the O

Several O

could O
be O
proof O
that O

says O
: O

for O
the O

In O
a O
groundbreaking O

researchers O
used O

The O

could O
throw O

10 O

Previous O

Conclusions O
Our O

that O
IAD O
demonstrated O
widespread O
reductions O

FA O
in O
major O

such O
abnormal O
white O

may O
be O
linked O
to O
some O
behavioral O
impairments O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
white O
matter O
integrity O
may O
serve O
as O
a O
potential O
new O
treatment O
target O
and O
FA O
may O
be O
as O
a O
qualified O
biomarker O
to O
understand O
the O
underlying O
neural O
mechanisms O

injury O

the O
effectiveness O

Analysis O
The O
Royal O
College O
of O
Psychiatrists O
told O
me O
that O
psychiatrists O
in O
the O
UK O
refer O
to O
two O
international O
sources O
to O
define O
whether O
a O
set O
of O
symptoms O
is O
a O
diagnosable O
illness O
or O
not O
. O

The O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
publishes O
International O
Classification O
of O
Diseases O
periodically O
, O
but O
the O
last O
came O
into O
use O
in O
1994 O
and O
therefore O
inevitably O
includes O
no O
reference O
to O
the O
internet O
. O

The O
other O
source O
is O
the O
American O

is O
due O
to O

updated O
next O
year O
. O

The O
committees O
responsible O
for O
formulating O
this O
policy O
has O
been O
debating O
whether O
to O
include O
internet O

in O
its O
section O
on O

. O

The O
current O
proposals O
reclassify O
internet O
gambling O
as O
an O
addiction O
rather O
than O
a O
compulsive O
behaviour O
but O
don O
' O
t O
include O
internet O
addiction O
in O
its O
own O
right O
. O

This O
is O
still O
open O
to O
consultation O
, O
fiercely O
contested O
and O
subject O
to O
new O
evidence O
, O
including O
potentially O
the O
Chinese O
study O
. O

Last O
year O
Charles O
O O
' O
Brien O
of O
the O
University O
of O
Pennsylvania O
, O
the O
chair O
of O
the O
addictions O
committee O
, O
said O
in O
a O
press O
conference O
reported O
here O
, O
that O
internet O
addiction O
would O
not O
be O
included O
but O
that O
they O
would O
recommend O
future O
research O
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
report O
said O
: O
He O
[ O
O O
' O
Brien O
] O
said O
his O
work O
group O
had O
considered O
including O
sex O
and O
Internet O
addictions O
as O
disorders O
, O
but O
decided O
there O
was O
insufficient O
evidence O
to O
allow O
development O
of O
reliable O
diagnostic O
criteria O
for O
them O
. O

Consequently O
, O
gambling O
addiction O
is O
slated O
to O
be O
the O
only O
disorder O
formally O
listed O
in O
the O
behavioral O
addictions O
category O
. O

But O
O O
' O
Brien O
added O
that O
, O
under O
current O
plans O
, O
sex O
and O
Internet O
addictions O
would O
be O
included O
in O
an O
appendix O
to O
DSM O
V O
, O
intended O
to O
encourage O
additional O
research O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
their O
inclusion O
in O
future O
editions O
. O

The O
first O
and O
obvious O
point O
to O
make O
about O
the O
Chinese O
study O
is O
that O
it O
' O
s O
very O
small O
and O
therefore O
not O
conclusive O
of O
anything O
. O

The O
second O
was O
made O
by O
Colin O
Drummond O
, O
professor O
of O
addiction O
psychiatry O
at O
Kings O
College O
London O
, O
which O
has O
the O
largest O
research O
centre O
for O
psychiatry O
in O
Europe O
, O
on O
the O
Today O
programme O
this O
morning O
. O

You O
can O
listen O
to O
him O
here O
and O
he O
' O
s O
just O
expanded O
his O
argument O
in O
a O
phone O
interview O
with O
me O
. O

I O
asked O
him O
whether O
internet O
addiction O
is O
a O
medical O
illness O
. O

He O
said O
: O
No O
. O

It O
' O
s O
interesting O
that O
people O
who O
use O
the O
internet O
excessively O
seem O
to O
have O
different O
brain O
structures O
compared O
with O
people O
who O
don O
' O
t O
but O
the O
big O
issue O
is O
whether O
we O
are O
looking O
at O
cause O
or O
effect O
. O

There O
is O
quite O
good O
evidence O
that O
people O
who O
engage O
in O
substance O
misuse O
and O
addictions O
and O
to O
some O
extent O
gambling O
do O
have O
problems O
with O
impulse O
control O
which O
fits O
with O
abnormalities O
in O
the O
frontal O
lobes O
of O
the O
brain O
similar O
to O
those O
in O
this O
study O
. O

But O
it O
is O
a O
big O
leap O
to O
go O
from O
there O
to O
suggest O
that O
the O
internet O
is O
re O
wiring O
your O
brain O
. O

If O
people O
have O
emotional O
problems O
and O
that O
leads O

that O

Perhaps O

I O
' O

not O

a O
problem O
for O

trying O
to O
classify O
it O

an O

risks O
attached O
to O

They O
are O
treating O
an O
addiction O
rather O

emotional O

that O

lead O

the O

people O
drawn O
to O
the O

because O
they O

Probably O
, O
that O
' O

part O

The O
implication O
people O
who O
disapprove O
of O
the O

can O
make O
is O
that O
it O
' O

harm O

In O
the O

more O

psychological O

all O

Alzheimer O

is O
by O

the O
most O
common O
dementia O

there O
is O
good O
reason O
to O
lavish O
attention O
on O
it O

there O
are O
many O
other O
forms O

such O

stroke O

it O

a O

said O
that O
looking O
at O
the O
trend O
last O
year O
, O
usually O
among O
those O
affected O
by O
dengue B-DIS
about O
50 O

would O
be O
children O

Adding O
his O
voice O
to O
the O
serious O
concerns O
expressed O
over O
the O
use O
of O
NSAIDs O
when O
dengue B-DIS
is O
rampant O
, O
he O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
guidelines O
for O
dengue B-DIS
management O
formally O
introduced O
by O
the O
Health O
Ministry O
in O
December O
2010 O
specifically O
advised O
against O
their O
use O
. O

If O
any O
child O
has O
fever O
, O
the O
first O
assumption O
should O
be O
that O
it O
is O
dengue B-DIS
, O
as O
this O
viral O
disease O
is O
now O
hyper O
endemic O
in O
Sri B-LOC

, O
he O
says O
. O

A O
few O
years O

if O
we O
saw O
10 O
children O
with O
fever O
, O
about O
2 O
3 O
would O
be O
dengue B-DIS
patients O
. O

But O
now O
in O
Colombo B-LOC
, O
of O
10 O
children O
with O
fever O
, O
we O
should O
suspect O
that O
five O
have O
dengue B-DIS
, O
while O
in O
Negombo B-LOC
it O
would O
be O
as O
high O

in O
Thailand O

also O
helped O
implement O
such O
measures O
in O
Pakistan O

, O
he O
said O
that O
when O
called O
upon O
to O
advise O
paediatricians O
all O
over O
the O
country O
on O
managing O
very O
ill O
children O
he O
had O
come O
across O
many O
who O
had O
bled O
due O
to O
being O
given O
either O
ibuprofen O
or O
mefenamic O
acid O
before O
admission O

. O

“ O
When O

down O

, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
even O
though O
fever O
could O
be O
a O
distressing O
symptom O
and O
parents O
may O
look O
for O
quick O

For O
, O
NSAIDs O

then O
do O
more O

, O
Dr O

Strauss O
says O
the O
name O
can O
be O
misleading O
as O
the O
patient O
actually O
remains O
conscious O
throughout O
the O
entire O
procedure O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
sedation O
dentistry O
according O
to O
Dr O
. O
Strauss O
is O
simply O
to O
put O
the O
patient O
in O
a O
state O
of O
relaxation O
to O
ensure O
they O
are O
not O
consumed O
by O
the O
fear O
they O
typically O
experience O
during O
dental O
treatment O
. O

While O
intravenous O
sedation O
is O
the O
traditional O
method O
used O
for O
sedation O
dentistry O
, O
Dr O
. O
Strauss O
says O
less O
invasive O
methods O
are O
gaining O
in O
popularity O
, O
including O
inhalation O
sedation O
and O
oral O
sedation O
. O

Regardless O
of O
the O
method O
employed O
, O
Dr O
. O
Strauss O
says O
the O
dental O
procedure O
does O
not O
necessarily O
determine O
the O
type O
of O
sedation O
method O
. O

Instead O
, O
he O
stresses O
the O
need O
to O
address O
each O
individual O
treatment O
plan O
along O
with O
the O
specifics O

patient O

before O
deciding O
on O
the O
type O
of O
sedation O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
Dr O
. O
Strauss O
says O
patients O
appreciate O
the O
sedation O
dentistry O
option O
at O
his O
practice O
because O
they O
do O
not O
have O
to O
feel O
the O
pain O
or O
experience O
anxiety O
associated O
with O
any O
number O
of O
the O
procedures O
he O
offers O
. O

However O
, O
Dr O
. O
Strauss O
says O
the O
main O
benefit O
of O
alleviating O
these O
concerns O
for O
his O
patients O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
allows O
him O

his O

maintain O
the O
oral O
health O

there O
is O
one O
bad O
thing O
, O
and O
that O
was O
that O
I O
was O
born O
so O
that O
I O
reached O
high O
school O
age O
right O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
disco O
era O
. O

At O
least O
, O
that O
’s O
the O
way O
I O
viewed O
it O
at O
the O
time O
because O
at O
the O
time O
, O
like O
many O
teenaged O
boys O
of O
that O
era O
, O
particularly O
in O
Detroit O
, O
I O
hated O
disco O
. O

Loathed O
it O
. O

Despised O
it O
. O

I O
used O
to O
draw O
cartoons O
in O
the O
back O
of O
my O
notebooks O
showing O
Robert O
Plant O
destroying O
disco O
records O
, O
and O
I O
was O
a O
card O
carrying O
member O
of O
DREAD O
. O

Not O
for O
me O
were O
the O
Bee O
Gees O
, O
who O
were O
so O
huge O
during O
my O
sophomore O
and O
junior O
years O
in O
high O
school O
, O
although O
I O
do O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
, O
even O
at O
the O
time O
, O
I O
did O
rather O
like O
the O
Trammps O
’ O
Disco O
Inferno O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
more O
than O
thirty O
years O
later O
, O
I O
now O
realize O
that O
it O
was O
rather O
silly O
to O
have O
such O
hostility O
towards O
disco O
. O

Heck O
, O
these O
days O
I O
even O
kind O
of O
like O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
old O
1970s O
disco O
, O
even O
going O
so O
far O
as O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
Studio O
54 O
Channel O
on O
Sirius O
XM O
when O
driving O
to O
work O
. O

In O
retrospect O
, O
I O
rather O
suspect O
that O
the O
whole O
hating O
disco O
thing O
was O
just O
part O
of O
my O
identity O
at O
the O
time O
, O
a O
convenient O
bit O
of O
tribalism O
by O
which O
teens O
associate O
with O
groups O
and O
declare O
who O
they O
are O
. O

Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
at O
the O
time O
I O
really O
, O
really O
, O
really O
, O
really O
hated O
the O
Bee O
Gees O
, O
who O
to O
me O
epitomized O
everything O
that O
I O
thought O
was O
wrong O
with O
music O
at O
the O
time O
. O

These O
days O
, O
I O
actually O
own O
the O
soundtrack O
for O
Saturday O
Night O
Fever O
, O
something O
unimaginable O
to O
me O
33 O
years O
ago O
. O

However O
, O
even O
during O
my O
most O
disco O
hating O
, O
Bee O
Gees O
hating O
phase O
, O
I O
wouldn’t O
have O
wished O
what O
what O
’s O
happened O
to O
Robin O
Gibb O
on O
him O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
have O
begun O
in O
2010 O
, O
when O
he O
was O
taken O
for O
emergency O
surgery O
for O
a O
bowel O
obstruction O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
several O
months O
Gibb O
looked O
increasingly O
frail O
and O
gaunt O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
I O
was O
shocked O
by O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
photos O
I O
saw O
of O
him O
. O

In O
April O
2011 O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
hospital O
with O
what O
were O
described O
by O
“ O
crippling O
” O
abdominal O
pain O
. O

Finally O
, O
in O
November O
, O
the O
cause O
of O
Gibb O
’s O
declining O
health O
was O
finally O
revealed O
, O
when O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
he O
had O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
liver O
cancer O
and O
that O
he O
wasn’t O
responding O
to O
treatment O
: O
Fears O
were O
growing O
for O
frail O
Bee O
Gees O
star O
Robin O
Gibb O
last O
night O
as O
he O
battled O
liver O
cancer O
. O

The O
stricken O
singer O
, O
61 O
, O
was O
given O
the O
devastating O
news O
the O
disease O
was O
getting O
worse O
after O
months O
of O
treatment O
failed O
to O
have O
an O
effect O
. O

He O
is O
being O
cared O
for O
at O
home O
by O
devoted O
wife O
Dwina O
while O
brother O
and O
bandmate O
Barry O
, O
64 O
, O
has O
flown O
in O
from O
the O
US O
to O
be O
by O
his O
side O
. O

A O
family O
friend O
said O
: O
“ O
We O
are O
all O
devastated O
. O

“ O
Robin O
has O
been O
a O
pinnacle O
of O
strength O
and O
is O
showing O
enormous O
courage O
and O
dignity O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
this O
terrible O
news O
. O
” O
The O
star O
— O
who O
has O
been O
painfully O
thin O
for O
months O
— O
has O
bravely O
told O
friends O
and O
family O
he O
wants O
to O
“ O
work O
until O
I O
drop O
” O
. O

Presumably O
, O
Gibb O
has O
hepatocellular O
cancer O
( O
HCC O
) O
, O
which O
is O
what O
is O
usually O
meant O
by O
“ O
liver O
cancer O
. O
” O
Not O
knowing O
any O
more O
details O
than O
what O
are O
contained O
in O
the O
various O
news O
reports O
, O
it O
’s O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
comment O
with O
any O
degree O
of O
certainty O
on O
Gibb O
’s O
condition O
, O
but O
we O
can O
make O
some O
inferences O
. O

First O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
Gibb O
hasn’t O
undergone O
surgery O
. O

This O
implies O
that O
, O
at O
the O
very O
minimum O
the O
cancer O
is O
unresectable O
, O
and O
it O
’s O
probably O
metastatic O
. O

I O
say O
it O
’s O
“ O
probably O
” O
metastatic O
because O
there O
is O
another O
treatment O
option O
for O
unresectable O
HCC O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
discussed O
it O
in O
considerable O
detail O
in O
the O
context O
of O
Steve O
Jobs O
’ O
liver O
metastases O
from O
his O
neuroendocrine O
tumor O
of O
the O
pancreas O
. O

That O
treatment O
is O
liver O
transplantation O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
results O
for O
liver O
transplantation O
as O
a O
treatment O
can O
be O
quite O
good O
, O
certainly O
better O
than O
the O
results O
for O
Jobs O
’ O
neuroendocrine O
tumor O
, O
but O
patient O
selection O
is O
key O
. O

Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
given O
that O
news O
reports O
indicate O
that O
Gibb O
has O
undergone O
several O
rounds O
of O
chemotherapy O
, O
we O
can O
pretty O
safely O
assume O
that O
Gibb O
’s O
tumor O
was O
neither O
resectable O
nor O
amenable O
to O
liver O
transplantation O
and O
therefore O
is O
almost O
certainly O
metastatic O
, O
which O
means O
, O
if O
I’m O
correct O
, O
it O
’s O
not O
curable O
. O

One O
should O
note O
, O
however O
, O
that O
“ O
not O
curable O
” O
doesn’t O
mean O
“ O
not O
treatable O
. O
” O
Palliation O
is O
very O
, O
very O
important O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
Gibb O
, O
I O
see O
another O
celebrity O
alt O
med O
tragedy O
fast O
approaching O
. O

The O
first O
indications O
came O
in O
November O
, O
not O
long O
after O
Gibb O
’s O
diagnosis O
was O
announced O
: O
Gibb O
’s O
wife O
, O
Dwina O
Murphy O
Gibb O
, O
an O
ordained O
druid O
priestess O
, O
said O
in O
an O
interview O
with O
Sky O
Arts O
TV O
that O
she O
’s O
looking O
into O
alternative O
treatments O
for O
her O
husband O
, O
including O
“ O
spider O
medicine O
, O
” O
a O
type O
of O
Native O
American O
healing O
approach O
. O

According O
to O
the O
website O

a O
licensed O
acupuncturist O
and O
tribal O
member O
of O
the O
Cherokee O

, O
spider O
medicine O
is O
a O
type O
of O
“ O
animal O
medicine O
, O
” O
which O
refers O
to O
the O
“ O
healing O
aspects O
that O
a O
particular O
animal O
brings O
to O
our O
consciousness O
. O
” O
“ O
As O
best O
I O
can O
tell O
, O
spider O
medicine O
is O
not O
medicine O

said O
Mark O
Boguski O
, O
MD O
, O
co O
founder O
of O
the O
Celebrity O

blog O
, O
which O
also O
appears O
on O
MedPage O
Today O
. O

“ O
However O
, O
there O
may O
be O
psychosocial O
benefits O
in O
the O
context O
of O
palliative O
treatment O
. O
” O
I O
pride O
myself O
in O
being O
aware O
of O
pretty O
much O
all O
forms O
of O
alternative O
medicine O
, O
but O
I O
must O
admit O
that O
I’ve O
never O
heard O
of O
“ O
spider O
medicine O
” O
before O
. O

So O
I O
went O
to O
the O
source O
, O
which O
tells O
me O
that O
spider O
medicine O
represents O
“ O
creativity O
” O
: O
Spider O
Medicine O
represents O
creativity O
. O

Its O
8 O
legs O
represent O
the O
4 O
winds O
of O
change O
and O
the O
4 O
directions O
on O
the O
medicine O
wheel O
. O

Its O
body O
is O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
an O
8 O
, O
which O
represents O
infinite O
possibilities O
. O

“ O
Spider O
people O
” O
must O
look O
beyond O
the O
web O
of O
illusion O
of O
the O
physical O
world O
and O
look O
beyond O
the O
horizon O
to O
other O
dimensions O
. O

Gibb O
’s O
wife O
apparently O
was O
convinced O
that O
this O
Native O
American O
“ O
medicine O
” O
can O
result O
in O
recovery O
from O
untreatable O
illnesses O
. O

But O
what O
is O
it O
? O

The O
source O
didn’t O
tell O
me O
much O
; O
so O
I O
went O
to O
the O
almighty O
Google O
. O

it O
didn’t O
tell O
me O
much O
either O
, O
other O
than O
that O
spider O
medicine O
is O
apparently O
some O
sort O
of O
spiritual O
treatment O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
there O
was O
a O
story O
in O
the O
news O
updating O
Gibb O
’s O
condition O
entitled O
Robin O
Gibb O
Is O
A O
Natural O
Fighter O
: O
BEE O
Gees O
star O
Robin O
Gibb O
has O
flown O
in O
a O
team O
of O
alternative O
medics O
from O
Switzerland O
as O
he O
battles O
liver O
cancer O
. O

Robin O
, O
62 O
, O
has O
braved O
seven O
rounds O
of O
gruelling O
chemotherapy O
to O
try O
to O
beat O
the O
illness O
and O
doctors O
are O
pleased O
with O
his O
response O
. O

Now O
he O
is O
getting O
24 O
hour O
care O
from O
the O
naturopath O
nutritionists O
at O
his O
mansion O
in O
Thame O
, O
Oxfordshire O
, O
to O
help O
boost O
his O

A O
close O
family O
pal O
said O
: O
“ O

He O
’s O
trying O
everything O
possible O
to O
beat O
this O
disease O
. O
” O
The O
naturopaths O
are O
believed O
to O
be O
the O
idea O
of O
his O
druid O
wife O
Dwina O
. O

The O
naturopathic O
approach O
tries O
to O
reduce O
surgery O
and O
drugs O
, O
relying O
instead O
on O
the O
body O
’s O
natural O
ability O
to O
heal O
itself O
through O
good O
nutrition O
. O

Whilst O
undergoing O
conventional O
treatment O
, O
Dwina O
has O
also O
encouraged O
Robin O
to O
undergo O
daily O
20 O
minute O
sessions O
in O
a O
detox O
hut O
to O
sweat O
out O
toxins O
. O

What O
irritates O
me O
about O
this O
article O
is O
not O
so O
much O
that O
Gibb O
is O
undergoing O
naturopathic O
treatment O
. O

He O
’s O
dying O
; O
he O
’s O
desperate O
; O
he O
has O
a O
wife O
is O
is O
, O
to O
put O
it O
kindly O
, O
very O
prone O
to O
woo O
. O

What O
would O
be O
amazing O
is O
if O
he O
managed O
to O
stick O
to O
science O
based O
treatment O
for O
palliation O
. O

He O
’s O
also O
incredibly O
wealthy O
; O
so O
the O
usual O
complaint O
of O
quacks O
sucking O
down O
the O
last O
money O
of O
a O
dying O
man O
doesn’t O
apply O
as O
much O
as O
it O
usually O
does O
. O

And O
, O
make O
no O
mistake O
, O
“ O
naturopathic O
oncology O
” O
is O
quackery O
, O
just O
as O
naturopathy O
is O
. O

For O
one O
thing O
, O
homeopathy O
is O
part O
and O
parcel O
of O
naturopathy O
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
there O
is O
no O
quackery O
that O
naturopaths O
don’t O
embrace O
. O

“ O
Energy O
healing O
, O
” O
“ O
detox O
” O
woo O
, O
unscientific O
use O
of O
supplements O
, O
these O
are O
just O
a O
few O
of O
the O
sorts O
of O
pseudoscience O
naturopaths O
embrace O
enthusiastically O
. O

What O
irritates O
me O
is O
the O
typical O
reporter O
lazily O
buying O
into O
the O
spin O
that O
naturopaths O
put O
on O
their O
quackery O
that O
“ O
good O
nutrition O
” O
can O
stimulate O
the O
body O
’s O
natural O
ability O
to O
heal O
itself O
, O
even O
to O
the O
point O
of O
healing O
an O
advanced O
malignancy O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
from O
what O
I O
can O
tell O
reading O
about O
Robin O
Gibb O
’s O
desperate O

fairly O
clear O
that O

unlikely O

” O
puns O
being O
bandied O
about O
nothwithstanding O
. O

It O
’s O
also O
clear O
that O
, O
contrary O
to O
what O
proponents O
of O
“ O
natural O
healing O
” O
tell O
us O
, O
eating O
the O
“ O
right O
” O
diet O
is O
no O
guarantee O
that O
you O
won’t O
get O
cancer O
. O

Multiple O
reports O
state O
that O
Gibb O
is O
a O
vegan O
and O
a O
teetotaler O
. O

Failure O
of O
cancer O
prevention O
notwithstanding O
, O
having O
a O
posse O
of O
naturopaths O
plying O
Gibb O
with O
their O
quackery O
isn’t O
helping O
matters O
. O

We O
can O
only O
hope O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
actually O
hasten O
his O
end O
. O

When O
that O
end O
comes O
, O
I O
predict O
that O
we O
will O
hear O
precious O
little O
about O
it O
from O
Mike O
Adams O
, O
Joe O
Mercola O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
“ O
natural O
cancer O
cure O
” O
cranks O
infesting O
the O
Internet O
. O

Mike O
Adams O
is O
well O
known O
for O
gloating O
over O
the O
deaths O
of O
celebrities O
from O
cancer O
( O
for O
instance O
, O
Patrick O
Swayze O
and O
Tony O
Snow O
) O
as O
“ O
proof O
” O
that O
“ O
chemo O
kills O
. O
” O
Actually O
, O
on O
second O
thought O
, O
I O
bet O
we O
will O
hear O
about O
it O
from O
Adams O
. O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
Gibb O
has O
reportedly O
undergone O
seven O
rounds O
of O
chemotherapy O
. O

That O
will O
give O
Adams O
the O
opening O
he O
needs O
to O
claim O
that O
it O
was O
the O
chemotherapy O
that O
killed O
Gibb O
and O
that O
, O
by O
the O
time O
Gibb O
listened O
to O
his O
druid O
priestess O
wife O
and O
turned O
to O
“ O
natural O
healing O
” O
it O
was O
“ O
too O
late O
” O
because O
the O
chemotherapy O
had O
already O
“ O
destroyed O
his O
immune O
system O
” O
and O
“ O
poisoned O
” O
him O
beyond O
retrieval O
. O

Yes O
, O
that O
’s O
what O
I O
now O
predict O
that O
Adams O
will O
say O
after O
Gibb O
finally O
succumbs O
to O
his O
disease O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
although O
I’d O
love O
to O
see O
Gibb O
be O
a O
long O
term O
survivor O
of O
his O
cancer O
, O
I O
doubt O
we O
have O
that O
long O
to O
wait O
to O
find O
out O
if O
my O
prediction O
is O

we O
found O
quite O
the O

We O
found O
that O
in O
countries O

legal O
, O
for O

in O
Belgium O

no O

think O
there O
is O
a O
strong O
case O
for O
redress O

which O
denies O
hundreds O

dignity O

we O
hope O
the O

support O
us O
on O
this O

duty O
of O
care O
should O
not O
exclude O
the O

on O
the O
