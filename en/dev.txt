“ O
These O

provide O
an O
interesting O
snapshot O
into O
how O
the O
crisis O

experienced O
by O
those O
working O
at O
the O
frontline O
of O

: O
nurses O
in O
both O
hospitals O
and O
in O
the O
community O
. O

“ O
These O
nurses O
report O
seeing O
social O
care O
services O
for O
older O
people O
reduced O
and O
as O
a O
result O
older O
people O
having O
to O
routinely O
stay O
in O
hospital O
longer O
than O
medically O
necessary O
because O
the O
support O
is O
not O
there O
for O
them O
to O
go O
home O
. O

This O
not O
only O
is O
distressing O
for O
older O
people O
but O
also O
makes O
no O
sense O
financially O
as O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
hospital O
bed O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
much O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
providing O
social O
care O
support O
. O
” O
She O
added O
: O
“ O
We O
urge O
the O
government O
to O
show O
vision O
by O
creating O
a O
system O
of O
social O
care O
that O
is O
fair O
and O
sustainable O
– O
the O
social O
care O
system O
is O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
collapse O
and O
needs O
urgent O
reform O
. O
” O
Queen O

Nursing O
Institute O
director O
Rosemary O
Cook O
said O
the O
causes O
of O
delayed O

had O
to O
be O
“ O
tackled O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
urgency O
” O
. O

She O
said O
: O
“ O
We O
know O
that O
people O
would O
rather O
be O
in O
their O
own O
homes O
, O
and O
are O
usually O
healthier O
and O
happier O
there O
. O

We O
also O
need O
to O
reduce O
the O
strain O
on O
our O
hospitals O
, O
so O
that O
as O
much O
time O
and O
care O
as O
possible O
is O
freed O
up O
for O
those O
patients O
who O
do O
need O
to O
be O
there O
. O
” O
“ O
The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
readiness O
of O
the O
community O
to O
receive O
people O
back O
for O
care O
has O
been O
going O
down O
, O
while O
the O
demand O
has O
been O
going O
up O
, O
” O
she O
added O
. O

“ O
Unless O
we O
reverse O
the O
trend O
towards O
dilute O
skill O
mix O
and O
over O
stretched O
community O

, O
we O
will O
not O

never O

” O
However O
, O
Ms O
Cook O
noted O
there O

some O
good O
initiatives O
around O
the O
country O

For O

, O
in O

were O
working O
across O

social O

, O
and O
in O
other O
places O
she O
said O
community O
nursing O
teams O
were O
now O
co O
located O
with O
social O

provide O
a O
more O
“ O
seamless O

patient O
ready O
” O
service O
for O
discharged O

. O

The O

Predators O

a O
more O

When O

, O
and O

But O
if O

anything O
to O
go O
by O
, O
predators O
have O
a O
surprisingly O
nutritious O
diet O
. O

Until O

, O

' O

any O

, O
New O

actually O
much O
more O
picky O
about O
the O

than O
previously O

To O
test O
this O
, O
the O
researchers O
took O
a O
bunch O
of O
female O
ground O
beetles O
a O
predatory O
insect O
that O
eats O
everything O
from O
slugs O
and O
moths O
to O
ants O
and O
other O
beetle O
larvae O
and O
placed O
them O
in O
two O
separate O
containers O
. O

In O
one O
, O
the O
beetles O
were O
presented O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
foods O
, O
some O
high O
in O
fat O
while O
others O
were O
high O
in O
protein O
. O

The O
other O
set O
of O
beetles O
were O
simply O
fed O
whatever O
the O
researchers O
gave O
them O
, O
and O
none O
were O
given O
the O
right O
balance O
of O
fat O
and O
protein O
. O

The O
first O
set O
of O
beetles O
consistently O
put O
together O
a O
balanced O
diet O
that O
included O
all O
the O
different O
foods O
provided O
. O

Thanks O
to O
this O
nutritious O
mixture O
, O
those O
beetles O
gave O
birth O
to O
much O
healthier O
offspring O
than O
their O
counterparts O
who O
weren O
' O
t O
allowed O
to O
make O
choices O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
any O
predator O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
seek O
out O
a O
balanced O
diet O
, O
but O
the O
researchers O
believe O
this O
is O
likely O
also O
true O
of O
predators O
throughout O
the O
animal O
kingdom O
On O
some O
level O
, O
this O
shouldn O
' O
t O
come O
as O
too O
much O
of O
a O
surprise O
previous O
studies O
of O
herbivorous O
and O
omnivorous O
insects O
have O
shown O
that O
they O
consistently O
go O
for O
a O
balanced O
diet O
that O
makes O
for O
healthier O
eggs O
. O

But O
scientists O
thought O
carnivorous O
predators O
might O
be O
different O
because O
they O
can O
' O
t O
always O
rely O
on O
steady O
sources O
of O
all O
the O
different O
prey O
they O
