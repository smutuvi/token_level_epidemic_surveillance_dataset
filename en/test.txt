Friday O
, O
Health O
Secretary O
Andrew O
Lansley O
said O
the O
Government O
would O
pay O
for O
all O
women O
who O
had O
received O
the O
implants O
on O
the O
NHS O
to O
have O
them O
replaced O
if O
they O
were O
worried O
, O
and O
advised O
that O
private O
cosmetic O
surgery O
firms O
had O
a O
“ O
moral O
duty O
” O
to O
do O
the O
same O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
NHS O
will O
also O
support O
the O
removal O
, O
but O
not O
replacement O
, O
of O
private O
PIP O
implants O
in O
cases O
where O
a O
doctor O
has O
agreed O
there O
is O
a O
clinical O
need O
. O

Many O
women O
in O
Northamptonshire O
and O
elsewhere O
are O
now O
faced O
with O
an O
uncomfortable O
wait O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
private O
clinics O
will O
agree O
to O
replace O
PIP O
implants O
at O
no O
cost O
. O

The O
PIP O
furore O
has O
led O
to O
widespread O
debate O
within O
the O
public O
and O
the O
industry O
itself O
over O
how O
far O
people O
’s O
confidence O
in O
the O
safety O
and O
regulation O
of O
cosmetic O
surgery O
will O
have O
been O
tarnished O
by O
this O
controversy O
. O

The O
Patients O
Eileen O
Newitt O
It O
was O
during O
the O
1960s O
when O
Blisworth O
resident O
Eileen O
Newitt O
underwent O
surgery O
to O
have O
lumps O
removed O
from O
her O
breasts O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
found O
that O
these O
lumps O
were O
not O
cancerous O
, O
the O
operation O
left O
Mrs O
Newitt O
requiring O
cosmetic O
implants O
to O
restore O
the O
appearance O
of O
her O
breasts O
. O

These O
implants O
were O
not O
PIP O
but O
the O
scandal O
which O
has O
been O
gracing O
newspaper O
headlines O
in O
recent O
weeks O
certainly O
sparked O
unpleasant O
memories O
as O
, O
since O
her O
operation O
in O
1985 O
, O
her O
implants O
have O
ruptured O
twice O
. O

The O
first O
rupture O
, O
in O
1993 O
, O
resulted O
in O
a O
court O
case O
for O
compensation O
in O
which O
she O
was O
awarded O
$ O
50,000 O
in O
compensation O
from O
an O
American O
company O
, O
losing O
all O
but O
$ O
850 O
to O
legal O
fees O
. O

She O
also O
underwent O
another O
operation O
to O
have O
this O
implant O
replaced O
. O

She O
said O
: O
“ O
I O
did O
not O
appeal O
as O
I O
did O
not O
have O
the O
finances O
or O
the O
legal O
know O
how O
to O
do O
it O
. O

When O
the O
call O
came O
to O
say O
they O
had O
been O
granted O
the O
permission O
( O
to O
take O
legal O
fees O
from O
the O
compensation O
) O
there O
was O
nothing O
left O
. O
” O
Her O
doctors O
have O
advised O
her O
that O
no O
urgent O
action O
needs O
to O
be O
taken O
about O
her O
most O
recent O
rupture O
, O
which O
was O
discovered O
11 O
years O
after O
the O
first O
, O
in O
2004 O
. O

But O
the O
recent O
story O
about O
PIP O
has O
left O
her O
worried O
. O

She O
said O
: O
“ O

consultant O

the O
hospital O
said O

not O
harm O
me O

have O
spoken O
to O
my O
GP O
and O
he O
also O
assured O
me O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O

about O

accepted O
this O

Here O
’s O
to O
helping O
you O
make O
an O
informed O
decision O
. O

Capsular O
Contracture O
This O
complication O
is O
caused O
by O
a O
scar O
that O
grows O
in O
your O
body O
, O
right O
is O
the O
tissue O
around O
the O
breast O
implant O
. O

This O
can O
lead O
to O
hardening O
, O
implants O
looking O
very O
fake O
, O
and O
they O
may O
even O
hurt O
. O

You O
see O
this O
condition O
more O
often O
than O
you O
may O
know O
. O

Women O
who O
have O
very O
unnatural O
, O
round O
, O
hard O
looking O
breasts O
that O
have O
obviously O
been O
worked O
on O
usually O
have O
bad O
cases O
of O
capsular O
contracture O
. O

Some O
say O
that O
saline O
implants O
lower O
the O
risks O
of O
this O
type O
of O
scar O
tissue O
and O
that O
it O
’s O
more O
common O
with O
silicone O
implants O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
conclusive O
evidence O
on O
this O
yet O
. O

This O
sounds O
pretty O
scary O
, O
but O
many O
women O
develop O
mild O
capsular O
contracture O
and O
don’t O
even O
know O
they O
have O
it O
. O

Moderate O
to O
severe O
scarring O
, O
however O
, O
is O
likely O
to O
cause O
you O
discomfort O
and O
requires O
additional O
surgery O
. O

What O
happens O
during O
the O
additional O
surgery O
is O
that O
all O
the O
scar O
tissue O
must O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
breasts O
and O
a O
new O
implant O
would O
have O
to O
be O
put O
in O
. O

Even O
when O
you O
do O
all O
that O
additional O
work O
, O
there O
’s O
a O
chance O
the O
scarring O
will O
come O
back O
again O
. O

Luckily O
, O
there O
is O
something O
you O
can O
do O
to O
lower O
this O
risk O
. O

Placing O
the O
implant O
under O
the O
muscle O
will O
help O
to O
reduce O
the O
breast O
implant O
risk O
of O
internal O
scar O

. O

Mammogram O
“ O
Blocking O
” O
When O
you O
have O
an O
implant O
, O
it O
becomes O
harder O
to O
view O
all O
your O
breast O
tissue O
during O
a O
mammography O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
mammograms O
are O
vitally O
important O
to O
your O
health O
. O

Just O
like O
with O
capusal O
contraction O
, O
having O
your O
implant O
placed O
under O
the O
muscle O
will O
help O
. O

With O
implants O
placed O
over O
the O
muscle O
, O
only O
about O
3/4 O
of O
your O
breast O
tissue O
can O
be O
seen O
during O
a O
mammogram O
. O

With O
it O
under O
the O
muscle O
, O
as O
much O
as O
90 O
% O
of O
your O
tissue O
can O
be O
seen O
– O
not O
perfect O
, O
but O
definitely O
better O
than O
75 O
% O
Breast O
Implant O
Displacement O
Just O
because O
your O
surgeon O
puts O
your O
implants O
in O
the O
right O
spot O
doesn’t O
necessarily O
mean O
they’ll O
stay O
there O
. O

There O
is O
a O
problem O
( O
albeit O
an O
uncommon O
one O
) O
where O
breast O
implants O
move O
after O
the O
surgery O
. O

This O
can O
happen O
in O
any O
direction O
, O
and O
at O
any O
time O
. O

Implants O
Breaking O
& O
Leaking O
As O
you O
may O
know O
, O
there O
are O
2 O
main O
types O
of O
implants O
– O
saline O
and O
silicone O
. O

Each O
of O
these O
present O
different O
risks O
if O
they O
were O
to O
leak O
or O
break O
. O

Let O
’s O
start O
with O
the O
safer O
of O
the O
two O
: O
saline O
implants O
. O

These O
sometimes O
develop O
a O
leak O
and O
start O
to O
deflate O
, O
leaving O
you O
with O
one O
breast O
that O
goes O
back O
to O
your O
original O
size O
. O

This O
happens O
most O
often O
with O
implants O
that O
have O
NOT O
been O
overfilled O
. O

Although O
it O
may O
sound O
wrong O
, O
overfilling O
implants O
actually O
helps O
them O
stay O
“ O
strong O
” O
. O

when O
the O
implant O
hasn’t O
been O
overfilled O
and O
a O
small O
piece O
folds O
over O
, O
it O
causes O
rubbing O
which O
wears O
the O
shell O
down O
. O

The O
shell O
can O
eventually O
become O
so O
thin O
that O
it O
tears O
, O
just O
like O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
. O

This O
happens O
most O
often O
during O
the O
first O
year O
following O
your O
procedure O
, O
and O
then O
the O
risk O
decreases O
in O
subsequent O
years O
. O

Your O
body O
is O
made O
of O
salt O
water O
, O
so O
the O
saline O
that O
filled O
your O
implant O
does O
no O
real O
harm O
when O
it O
’s O
absorbed O
by O
your O
body O
. O

The O
implant O
would O
just O
need O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

When O
you O
have O
silicone O
implants O
, O
the O
gel O
that O
fills O
the O
implant O
can’t O
be O
safely O
absorbed O
by O
your O
body O
. O

The O
shell O
can O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
and O
start O
to O
leak O
or O
even O
rupture O
, O
but O
the O
complications O
here O
are O
a O
little O
worse O
. O

The O
silicone O
leaking O
out O
of O
the O
implant O
will O
probably O
cause O
your O
body O
to O
form O
scar O
tissue O
around O
it O
. O

If O
the O
leak O
is O
a O
small O
one O
, O
you O
might O
not O
even O
notice O
that O
anything O
has O
even O
happened O
to O
your O
implant O
until O
you O
realize O
you O
have O
capsular O
contracture O
– O
the O
internal O
scarring O
we O
talked O
about O
earlier O
. O

This O
obviously O
requires O
surgery O
, O
as O
you O
can’t O
just O
leave O
a O
leaking O
silicone O
implant O
in O
your O
body O
. O

The O
implant O
and O
scar O
tissue O
would O
both O
need O
to O
be O
removed O
, O
and O
the O
implant O
would O
have O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

Rippling O
While O
some O
implants O
come O
out O
looking O
great O
and O
very O
natural O
, O
sometimes O
you O
get O
weird O
“ O
ripples O
” O
or O
slight O
waves O
that O
appear O
on O
your O
skin O
where O
the O
implants O
are O
placed O
. O

some O
surgeons O
also O
call O
this O
wrinkling O
. O

This O
happens O
because O
the O
saline O
contained O
in O
your O
implant O
is O
shifting O
around O
, O
leaving O
areas O
of O
“ O
loose O
” O
skin O
without O
anything O
to O
fill O
it O
. O

Overfilling O
the O
implants O
can O
help O
prevent O
rippling O
, O
as O
well O
as O
using O
smooth O
implants O
rather O
than O
textured O
ones O
. O

Placing O
the O
implants O
under O
the O
muscle O
can O
also O
help O
prevent O
rippling O
in O
the O
upper O
portion O
of O
the O
breasts O
. O

Rippling O
hardly O
ever O
happens O
to O
silicone O
implants O
, O
and O
is O
more O
evident O
among O
those O
who O
choose O
saline O
. O

Numb O
Nipples O
Numbness O
in O
the O
nipples O
following O
breast O
surgery O
is O
so O
common O
that O
you O
shouldn’t O
even O
consider O
having O
breast O
augmentation O
done O
if O
you O
really O
can’t O
stand O
the O
thought O
of O
potentially O
losing O
sensation O
in O
your O
nipples O
. O

Infection O
If O
you O
should O
develop O
an O
infection O
, O
you’ll O
need O
to O
take O
antibiotics O
and O
remove O
the O
implant O
. O

You O
can’t O
replace O
the O
implant O
until O
at O
least O
6 O
months O
down O
the O
road O
( O
allowing O
your O
body O
to O
heal O
properly O
) O
so O
you O
could O
go O
for O
awhile O
with O
lopsided O
breasts O
. O

Symmastia O
This O
is O
actually O
a O
rare O
one O
, O
but O
quite O
a O
problem O
if O
it O
happens O
. O

It O
can O
occur O
when O
implants O
are O
placed O
under O
the O
muscle O
and O
move O
together O
, O
leading O
to O
a O
“ O
uniboob O
” O
look O
. O

This O

This O

more O

For O
the O
last O

or O

I’ve O
kept O
my O
trap O
shut O
as O
assorted O
“ O

” O
have O
kicked O
off O
in O
the O
media O
and O
on O
the O
social O
networks O
about O
PIP O
breast O
implants O
. O

The O
gist O
of O
their O
arguments O
seems O
to O
be O
that O
if O
women O
are O
vain O
enough O
to O
get O
implants O
then O
they O
should O
not O
expect O
to O
have O
them O
removed O
on O
the O
NHS O

Today O
I O
could O
bite O
my O

no O

as O
the O
latest O
fuckwit O
blethered O
on O
about O
women O
wanting O
big O
tits O
to O
get O
a O
man O
or O
a O
career O
and O
therefore O
it O
’s O
their O
own O
fault O
if O
the O
implants O
explode O
and O
kill O
them O
. O

Several O
of O
these O
people O
have O
been O
saying O
that O
if O
women O
had O
better O
self O
esteem O
they O
wouldn’t O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
have O
ginormous O
tits O
and O
that O
we O
should O
all O
be O
happy O
with O
the O
way O
we O
were O
born O
. O

What O
I O
find O
both O
fascinating O
and O
repulsive O
is O
that O
most O
of O
the O
people O
making O
these O
comments O
are O
women O
. O

Women O
who O
regularly O
bleach O
their O
hair O
, O
wear O
make O
up O
, O
women O
– O
one O
of O
whom O
I O
know O
for O
a O
fact O
had O
a O
pretty O
extreme O
eating O
disorder O
in O
her O
youth O
– O
who O
spend O
a O
fortune O
on O
clothes O
, O
handbags O
, O
shoes O
etc O
etc O
to O
look O
the O
best O
they O
can O
. O

And O
yet O
they O
have O
the O
audacity O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
I O
was O
a O
vain O
, O
stupid O
bimbo O
because O
I O
had O
breast O
implants O
? O

I O
didn’t O
have O
them O
to O
get O
onto O
Page O
3 O
or O
Stringfellow O
’s O
pole O
, O
I O
had O
them O
because O
when O
I O
lost O
weight O
I O
lost O
all O
of O
my O
tits O
, O
so O
I O
had O
the O
smallest O
implants O
known O
to O
man O
inserted O
and O
paid O
a O
fortune O
for O
them O
. O

Luckily O
for O
me O
they O
are O
not O
the O
ones O
that O
are O
making O
headlines O
, O
but O
they O
just O
as O
easily O
could O
be O
and O
I O
too O
would O
be O
at O
the O
mercy O
of O
these O
sanctimonious O
bitches O
who O
claim O
sisterhood O
but O
hate O
all O
women O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
went O
to O
that O
clinic O
I O
sat O
there O
with O
women O
who O
had O
all O
kinds O
of O
breast O
problems O
, O
but O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
spot O
the O
ones O
who O
had O
the O
biggest O
problem O
When O
I O
was O
14 O
I O
discovered O
a O
lump O
in O
my O
right O
breast O
. O

I O
was O
scared O
and O
terrified O
of O
having O
cancer O
so O
I O
stupidly O
said O
nothing O
to O
anyone O
for O
close O
to O
a O
year O
. O

My O
silly O
schoolgirl O
thinking O
was O
that O
I O
would O
rather O
be O
dead O
than O
walk O
around O
with O
one O
breast O
. O

In O
those O
days O
if O
you O
had O
a O
mastectomy O
there O
was O
no O
reconstructive O
surgery O
. O

Eventually O
I O
told O
my O
mum O
and O
the O
next O
morning O
we O
were O
at O
the O
Doctors O
and O
within O
minutes O
I O
was O
told O
it O
was O
a O
lymph O
node O
. O

Luckily O
for O
me O
it O
went O
away O
of O
its O
own O
accord O
so O
I O
had O
no O
surgery O
. O

My O
GP O
at O
the O
time O
said O
something O
that O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
really O
prophetic O
, O
he O
said O
‘ O
you’re O
one O
of O
those O
girls O
who O
will O
always O
have O
lumpy O
breasts O
’ O
. O

When O
I O
was O
17 O
and O
living O
in O
London O
I O
got O
another O
lump O
, O
this O
time O
in O
the O
left O
breast O
. O

It O
was O
right O
behind O
the O
nipple O
and O
the O
size O
of O
a O
pea O
, O
again O
I O
was O
stupid O
and O
kept O
it O
quiet O
for O
longer O
than O
I O
should’ve O
done O
for O
the O
fear O
of O
it O
being O
cancer O
. O

My O
other O
thought O
was O
it O
that O
was O
just O
another O
lymph O
node O
and O
therefore O
no O
need O
to O
be O
making O
a O
big O
old O
fuss O
. O

I O
eventually O
saw O
a O
doctor O
who O
referred O
me O
to O
a O
breast O
specialist O
. O

This O
one O
wasn’t O
a O
lymph O
node O
, O
and O
so O
the O
tests O
began O
. O

I O
must O
have O
the O
luck O
of O
the O
Irish O
cause O
it O
was O
a O
benign O
cyst O
and O
it O
was O
removed O
immediately O
. O

I O
was O
in O
hospital O
only O
a O
few O
hours O
and O
that O
was O
that O
for O
me O
. O

On O
that O
ward O
were O
several O
women O
who O
weren’t O
so O
lucky O
, O
and O
the O
fear O
of O
breast O
cancer O
grew O
in O
me O
. O

Around O
10 O
years O
ago O
another O
lump O
came O
in O
my O
left O
breast O
, O
this O
one O
was O
different O
to O
all O
of O
the O
others O
, O
it O
was O
sore O
, O
it O
was O
deep O
inside O
the O
breast O
and O
it O
was O
making O
the O
whole O
breast O
hot O
and O
red O
. O

It O
seemed O
to O
flare O
up O
overnight O
almost O
, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
hanging O
about O
this O
time O
. O

I O
took O
a O
cab O
to O
St O
Mary O
’s O
hospital O
and O
went O
straight O
to O
A&E O
. O

; O
It O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
an O
abscess O
that O
was O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
rupturing O
. O

Luckily O
for O
me O
I’d O
caught O
it O
just O
in O
time O
, O
and O
avoided O
any O
major O
repercussions O
. O

I O
was O
kept O
in O
hospital O
and O
the O
abscess O
was O
monitored O
and O
eventually O
drained O
of O
the O
most O
disgusting O
looking O
pus O
I’ve O
ever O
seen O
. O

I’d O
been O
given O
a O
huge O
shot O
of O
yummy O
morphine O
and O
I O
remember O
lying O
on O
the O
bed O
watching O
the O
doctor O
drain O
this O
thing O
using O
ultrasound O
. O

On O
the O
monitor O
I O
could O
see O
the O
abscess O
and O
looking O
down O
at O
my O
boob O
I O
could O
see O
the O
green O
yucky O
poison O
coming O
out O
. O

Because O
I O
was O
off O
my O
tits O
( O
almost O
literally O
) O
I O
felt O
no O
pain O
and O
was O
just O
fascinated O
by O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

For O
several O
weeks O
and O
months O
afterwards O
I O
was O
kept O
under O
observation O
by O
the O
breast O
specialist O
at O
St O
Mary O
’s O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
it O
wasn’t O
cancerous O
and O
that O
it O
didn’t O
return O
. O

I O
can O
still O
remember O
how O
scared O
I O
felt O
as O
I O
went O
in O
to O
be O
told O
whether O
it O
was O
cancerous O
or O
not O
. O

At O
the O
back O
of O
my O
mind O
though O
was O
the O
thought O
that O
even O
if O
I O
had O
to O
have O
a O
mastectomy O
, O
I O
could O
have O
the O
breast O
rebuilt O
and O
this O
was O
a O
great O
comfort O
to O
me O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
went O
to O
that O
clinic O
I O
sat O
there O
with O
women O
who O
had O
all O
kinds O
of O
breast O
problems O
, O
but O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
spot O
the O
ones O
who O
had O
the O
biggest O
problem O
. O

They O
were O
the O
women O
sitting O
there O
with O
headscarves O
on O
, O
they O
were O
the O
ones O
who O
seemed O
to O
be O
on O
first O
name O
terms O
with O
the O
nurses O
, O
they O
were O
the O
ones O
who O
had O
this O
‘ O
look O
’ O
in O
their O
eyes O
, O
a O
look O
I O
couldn’t O
begin O
to O
explain O
. O

Brave O
, O
amazing O
women O
. O

So O
anyone O
who O
says O
that O
women O
who O
get O
implants O
are O
vain O
, O
stupid O
, O
a O
drain O
on O
the O
nation O
’s O
purse O
etc O
, O
think O
first O
you O
have O
no O
idea O
who O
you O
are O
judging O
To O
hear O
these O
self O
righteous O
bitches O
on O
Twitter O
and O
Facebook O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
media O
, O
banging O
on O
about O
vain O
women O
getting O
implants O
when O
there O
are O
women O
out O
there O
with O
implants O
for O
a O
multitude O
of O
reasons O
makes O
me O
so O
angry O
! O

So O
five O
years O
ago O
I O
had O
my O
implants O
done O
. O

My O
surgeon O
– O
Mr O
Jan O
Stanek O
– O
was O
made O
fully O
aware O
of O
my O
history O
of O
‘ O
lumpy O
tits O
’ O
and O
he O
assured O
me O
it O
was O
fine O
to O
put O
these O
implants O
in O
. O

My O
GP O
also O
said O
there O
was O
no O
problem O
with O
having O
this O
work O
done O
. O

Touch O
wood O
, O
there O
never O
has O
been O
a O
problem O
with O
them O
– O
so O
far O
. O

But O
that O
left O
breast O
, O
the O
one O
where O
the O
abscess O
was O
? O

Well O
that O
has O
been O
a O
problem O
. O

The O
abscess O
has O
returned O
twice O
and O
now O
, O
because O
I O
paid O
privately O
to O
have O
my O
boobs O
done O
, O
I O
am O
no O
longer O
eligible O
to O
have O
any O
treatment O
whatsoever O
on O
the O
NHS O
. O

As O
regards O
to O
the O
“ O
taxpayer O
” O
footing O
the O
bill O
for O
our O
“ O
vanity O
” O
, O
well O
here O
’s O
my O
take O
on O
that O
… O
The O
first O
time O
I O
got O
a O
lump O
– O
post O
boob O
job O
– O
I O
went O
to O
the O
breast O
clinic O
, O
the O
same O
one O
that O
had O
treated O
me O
10 O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
they O
refused O
to O
even O
look O
at O
it O
because O
I’d O
had O
work O
done O
. O

They O
had O
the O
notes O
there O
, O
they O
knew O
this O
was O
something O
that O
was O
pre O
boob O
job O
, O
but O
they O
still O
sent O
me O
away O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
pay O
£ O
2000 O
to O
get O
it O
removed O
privately O
. O

Mr O
Stanek O
did O
the O
surgery O
for O
free O
but O
the O
anesthetist O
and O
the O
hospital O
wanted O
paying O
! O

The O
second O
time O
was O
while O
I O
was O
travelling O
last O
year O
and O
again O
I O
had O
to O
turn O
to O
the O
private O
sector O
. O

So O
anyone O
who O
says O
that O
women O
who O
get O
implants O
are O
vain O
, O
stupid O
, O
a O
drain O
on O
the O
nation O
’s O
purse O
etc O
, O
think O
first O
you O
have O
no O
idea O
who O
you O
are O
judging O
. O

The O
whole O
point O
of O
these O
PIP O
implants O
is O
that O
the O
Medicines O
and O
Healthcare O
products O
Regulatory O
Agency O
passed O
them O
as O
fit O
for O
purpose O
in O
the O
UK O
. O

The O
NHS O
have O
also O
used O
them O
in O
reconstructive O
surgery O
on O
a O
number O
of O
women O
. O

So O
here O
’s O
a O
thought O
, O
how O
about O
all O
the O
women O
who O
were O
mis O
sold O
these O
impure O
implants O
pay O
to O
get O
them O
removed O
themselves O
then O
sue O
the O
government O
to O
fuck O
for O
not O
doing O
their O
job O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Would O
that O
make O
you O
feel O
better O
? O

Or O
should O
these”bimbos O
” O
just O
leave O
them O
in O
their O
bodies O
and O
wait O
for O
them O
to O
explode O
? O

Shame O
on O
every O
single O
woman O
who O
has O
taken O
the O
stance O
that O
those O
with O
implants O
are O
‘ O
getting O
what O
they O
deserve O
’ O
. O
